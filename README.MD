#This code includes a more advanced BaroqueChessAgent class that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for move generation. The evaluate_board function provides a simple evaluation of the board based on material balance. Adjustments and enhancements can be made to improve the evaluation function and the overall performance of the agent. Additionally, the play_tournament function allows multiple agents to compete against each other in a specified number of rounds.

Initialization: The init method initializes the agent with the board state, color, and maximum search depth.

Evaluation Function: The evaluate_board method evaluates the current board position based on piece values.

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning: The minimax and alpha_beta_pruning methods implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. These methods consider possible future moves and select the best move based on the evaluation function.

Make Move: The make_move method selects the best move for the current player using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

Play: The play method simulates the gameplay, making moves for the agent until the game is over.

Tournament: The play_tournament function allows multiple agents to compete against each other in a specified number of rounds, keeping track of their scores.
